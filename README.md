## 💻 Usage

### Using Formidable

1.  Send a `POST` request to `/upload` with a form containing a file field.
2.  The server will save the file in the `upload_test` directory.
3.  The response will include the file path.

### Using Multer

1.  Send a `POST` request to `/upload_mult` with a form containing a file field named `file` and any other necessary fields.
2.  The server will:
    - Save the file in the `upload_2` directory.
    - Upload the file to Cloudinary.
    - Delete the local file.
3.  The response will include the Cloudinary URL.
